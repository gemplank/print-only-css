# Print Only CSS Plugin

A WordPress plugin to add print-only css styling. I came across a need to make this plugin when I didn't have FTP/SFTP/Git access to a site.

If you'd like to make this fit for your site, you just need to alter the styles inside `print-style-css/css/style.css`

**Helpful Tip!**

If you want to test the print css changes in Chrome, instead of constantly `[right_click] -> Print` you can click the three black dots inside your inspector controls and go to `More tools -> Rendering -> Emulate CSS media -> Print` and that will emulate what your web page would look like if it was printed.
